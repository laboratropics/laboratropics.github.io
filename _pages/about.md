# Who Are We?
**Laboratropics is a research lab, based out of Cairns in Queensland, investigating our relationships with nature and seek to making use of digital symbiosis as a means for better living conditions and future prospects**

We are interested in the changes of health and climate, the impacts or causes thereof and how we can better monitor such cases to gain a stronger understanding of future trends. The tropics as a whole excites us and we are leading research on speciality tools which when ready to be utilised for solutions to everyday struggles could revolutionise the medical sector and change policy making. Aside from agriculture research we are also very interested in progressing the human in its environment by sharing education and knowledge on exciting and vital topics, including basic life, chemistry, biology and medicine or whatever other sciences are at the front of our minds currently.

**Our mission with this organisation is far from simple, as any visionary will tell you, building the future takes time.**

And we are here to work this out, by staying on the level of lines of code, calculus graphs and genomic classes. We are bound to designing the strongest solutions based on scientific standards. Take for example the issue of sustainability and what one may consider "future proof" is our definition of _basic co-existance theory_ and is practically put into use everyday in our lab. Put in less fragmented terms, all of our efforts will always be mindful of our environments and in regard of the future as to exist in the generations to come.

Take care,

Florian Eisen : Founder & Researcher of `Laboratropics`
